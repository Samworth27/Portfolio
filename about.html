                    Born in Tamworth, 1993. Growing up I lived all around Australia. Early in primary school I developed an interest in technology which grew throughout my schooling, learning HTML, CSS and actionscript in my first year of High School for fun. Later I also became pasionate about aviation and dreamed of becoming a fighter pilot. 
                    I failed my first attempt at joining the RAAF at 17, was denied the chance to test for Army pilot after being 2 minutes late at 19. Deciding to experience something different I moved to NSW and spent a year working as a farm hand before moving to Port Lincoln, SA and tried my hand at working as a deck hand on fishing boats. Following that I enlisted in the Army as a UAS operator at 21.

                    During my time in Army I was able to enjoy many experiences the average person wouldn't get to and also "enjoy" a few experiences most people would never want to.
                    Although I never deployed overseas I was lucky enough to spend Three months training in Malaysia and also spent Six months operating Unmanned Aerial Systems in North Queensland supporting other government agencies.
                    In Febuary 2022 I left Army after Seven years (at least Three years total spent away), Two promotions and One operation to persue a career in software development.
